Hello there! My name is Luis Da Costa and this is my version of a HandWriting.io app for iOS.

## Idea

**The Idea** was to simply create an iOS app based on the [API](https://handwriting.io/docs/) provided by [HandWriting.io](https://handwriting.io/). It was based on the base functions provided by the [demo](https://handwriting.io/), in which I added a touch of creativity in order to avoid being exactly the same as the demo provided.

## Design
**The Design** is based on the following ideas:

* Follow the [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=app-review-ios-hig) provided by Apple
* Show only the most relevant informations on the screen
* User Friendly experience
* Beautiful to the touch, beautiful to the eyes

The result is a simple "dual view", which is devised on two sections:

* The Main (First) screen (with the options):

* The Second (Final) screen (with the final result):
